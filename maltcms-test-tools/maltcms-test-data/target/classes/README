File Origin and original authors:

The .cdf.gz files contained within the cdf.1D folder were recorded and kindly provided by
Tony Watt (Metabolomics and Proteomics Group) and Heiko Neuweger (Computational Genomics/Bioinformatics Resource Facility),
Bielefeld University, Germany.
The .txt files within the same folder were created by 
Heiko Neuweger.

The .cdf.gz files contained withing the cdf.2D folder 
were recorded and kindly provided by Anja Doebbe (Algae Biotechnology Group) and Matthias Keck (Metabolomics and Proteomics Group),
Bielefeld University, Germany.

The files within the mzData, mzXML and mzML folders 
were downloaded from the psidev specification website at http://www.psidev.info/mzml.

The files
R1_RG59_B4_1.mzXML.gz
and 
jmzreader-mzdata_example.mzdata.xml.gz

were downloaded from the jmzreader project and converted using ProteoWizard's
msconvert function to create a subset of the original files with fewer mass spectra.

Some files have been renamed to conform with Maltcms IO-Provider policy, that xml-based formats 
should indicate their filetype within the file name. E.g. for file.mzData or file.mzData.xml.
