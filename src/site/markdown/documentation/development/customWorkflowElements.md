<h2>Custom Workflow Elements</h2>
Check out the git example from [GitHub](https://github.com/nilshoffmann/maltcms-extension-module.git).

The module defines additional fragment commands and defines a pipeline configuration for it.

In order to use the module, you need to place the jar file into the `lib/` directory of the maltcms 
distribution. You can either build the distribution from the maltcms maven project by invoking the __install__ target, the result is then available below `maltcms-distribution/target`. Alternatively, 
you can download the latest Maltcms release from [here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/maltcms/files/maltcms/), and follow the [installation instructions](../../gettingStarted.html).
