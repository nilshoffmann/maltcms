OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description: Maltcms, short for "Modular Applicati
 on Toolkit for Chromatography Mass-Spectrometry" is an application fr
 amework mainly suited for developers working in the domain of bioinfo
 rmatics for metabolomics and proteomics. Its aim is to provide reusab
 le, efficient datastructures, abstracting from the various low-level 
 data-formats like netcdf (ANDIMS), mzXML, mzData and mzML and providi
 ng consistent access to data features like mass spectra, chromatogram
 s and metadata. Furthermore, Maltcms provides a platform for the impl
 ementation and execution of processing pipelines. New and existing al
 gorithms can be easily implemented or included and executed together 
 with existing processing elements.
