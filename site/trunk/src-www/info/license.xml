        <h2>Versions 1.3+</h2>  
        <p> 
            Starting from release version 1.3, the sourcecode of Maltcms (which includes ChromA and ChromA4D) is 
            dual-licensed under the
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0-standalone.html">L-GPL v3 license</a>
                </li>
                and the
                <li>
                    <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html">Eclipse Public License v1.0</a>.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                If you use Maltcms, you may choose which of these two licenses will apply to it.
                Both licenses are 
                <a href="http://opensource.org">approved OpenSource licenses</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please read the terms and conditions of either license carefully before making your decision.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you plan to use Maltcms in the context of Eclipse, you should use the EPL-licensed version of Maltcms,
                as there exist known incompatibilities between EPL and L-GPL. 
            </p>
            <p>
                For other use-cases, the L-GPL v3 may be sufficient.
            </p>
            <h2>License Implications</h2>
            <p>
                If you simply use Maltcms within your own application or framework, e.g. by building upon existing interfaces and classes,
                there is no need to license your application under the same license as Maltcms. However, if you extend or alter
                the source code of Maltcms, both licenses require you to license your derivative work under the same license as Maltcms.
            </p>
        </p>
        <h2>Versions prior to 1.3</h2>
        <p>
            For release versions prior to 1.3 (1.2, 1.1, ...), the sourcecode of Maltcms (which includes ChromA and ChromA4D) is
            licensed exclusively under the 
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0-standalone.html">L-GPL v3 OpenSource license</a>
                </li>
