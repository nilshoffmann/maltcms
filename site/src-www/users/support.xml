        <h2>Mailing list</h2>
        <p>
            We generally recommend the use of the mailing list maltcms-user for
            novice users of Maltcms, ChromA and ChromAUI. This is the place to
            get in contact with the
            developers
            quickly and ask questions on just
            about everything. You can subscribe to the mailing list
            <a href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/maltcms-user"
            >here
            </a>
            or post a message anonymously, which will then be published at the
            list moderator's discretion. If you discover bugs and are not sure on
            how to report them, we would also recommend to post your
            findings on the list, so that we can create a bug tracker item for you.
        </p>
        <h2>Bug reporting</h2>
        <p>
            If you happen to stumble across bugs in Maltcms or any associated
            application, we would appreciate your feedback.
            We provide a publicly accessible
            <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=251287&amp;atid=1126545">issue tracker</a>, which does not require
            you to have an account at sourceforge. However, in order to be able to
            contact you, we recommend to register an account with sourceforge, or
            register on
            the mailing list, where you can also submit a bug report directly.
