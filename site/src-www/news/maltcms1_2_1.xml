        <h1>Maltcms 1.2.1 Released on September 11th, 2012</h1>
        <p>The Modular Application Toolkit for Chromatography Mass Spectrometry project is a framework mainly for programmers
            and power-users for data preprocessing tasks, such as filtering, baseline correction, peak finding, alignment,
            and visualization of high-throughput data.
