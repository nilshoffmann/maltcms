        <h2>Versions 1.3+</h2>  
        <p> 
            Starting from release version 1.3, the sourcecode of Maltcms (which includes ChromA and ChromA4D) is 
            dual-licensed under the
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0-standalone.html">L-GPL v3 license</a>
                </li>
                and the
                <li>
                    <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html">Eclipse Public License v1.0</a>.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                If you use Maltcms, you may choose which of these two licenses will apply to it.
                Both licenses are 
                <a href="http://opensource.org">approved OpenSource licenses</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please read the terms and conditions of either license carefully before making your decision.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you plan to use Maltcms in the context of Eclipse, you should use the EPL-licensed version of Maltcms,
                as there exist known incompatibilities between EPL and L-GPL. 
            </p>
            <p>
                For other use-cases, the L-GPL v3 may be sufficient.
            </p>
        </p>
