Requirements:
Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 1.6.0, http://java.sun.com/javase/6/
The scripts will try to guess the location of your java installation.
In case of failure, simply add a file "javahome" to the directory in which 
this README is located, consisting of one line holding the path to your JRE.

Libraries contained in lib/ need to be in classpath,
which is built automatically when calling 'scripts/maltcms.sh'

Please note:
The scripts will always prompt for the installation directory of 
maltcms, if you do not set the environment variable MALTCMSDIR
to the installation location. We recommend to add 

export MALTCMSDIR=/path/to/your/maltcms/

to your $HOME/.bashrc or $HOME/.profile file.
Alternatively, simply overwrite the environment variable within
scripts/maltcms.sh and scripts/maltcms-interactive.sh to set 
it to a fixed location.

Running Maltcms:
>scripts/maltcms.sh -- -i <INPUTDIR> -o <OUTPUTDIR> -f <FILES>
Required inputs are:
-i <INPUTDIR> (e.g. /vol/data)
-o <OUTPUTDIR> (e.g. /vol/output)
-f <FILES> (e.g. "*.cdf")

>scripts/maltcms.sh -- -h
prints command-line options with explanations.

For interactive input of the parameters:
>scripts/maltcms-interactive.sh
which will ask you interactively for the most important things.
It will provide defaults, where appropriate.

If you prefer a graphical wizard to help you create a configuration:
>scripts/maltcms.sh -exec maltcms.ui.wizard.PipelineWizard --

Remarks:
Currently, netCDF compatible input and output is 
supported, mzXML input works reliably for MS1 data, output is
currently redirected to netCDF format. Additionally, mzData is supported 
as input format, but again, output is redirected to netCDF format.

To get some insight into the parameters used by Maltcms and possible
alternatives, consult the properties files in cfg/, especially
 * alignment.properties
 * preprocessing.properties
 * graphics.properties

Examples for custom configurations can be found in all files prefixed
with "my_". Custom configuration files can be provided to maltcms.sh and 
maltcms-interactive.sh, overriding default values with the -c option.

File format for Anchors:
Anchor files start with a file designation in their first line:
Path can be omitted, if ORIGINAL_DATA_FILE and anchor file are both located 
in input basedirectory (cmdline option -i). Otherwise, the absolute path to
the original file has to be given.
>NAME_OF_ORIGINAL_DATA_FILE.cdf

The second line defines the column names:
Name	RI	RT	Scan

All following lines contain information for one anchor each:

RI1	-	-	230
RI2	-	-	430

etc.

Note that columns RI and RT are optional, Scan and Name are required.
Anchor names should be identical for matched compounds.

Full example:
File Example1.txt would look like this:
>Example1.cdf
Name	RI	RT	Scan
RI1	-	-	230
RI2	-	-	430
RI3	-	-	600
	
File Example2.txt would look like this:
>Example2.cdf
Name	RI	RT	Scan
RI1	-	-	234
RI2	-	-	437
RI3	-	-	598
