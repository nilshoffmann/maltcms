This is the Maltcms-Modules maven2 project.
Within this directory, you will find all the submodules, which 
make up Maltcms.

Building a release distribution:
From the base directory (where this file is located), call:
>mvn clean && mvn install

Change to the maltcms folder and call:
>mvn package

This will generate the appropriate artifacts below the target/ 
directory.
