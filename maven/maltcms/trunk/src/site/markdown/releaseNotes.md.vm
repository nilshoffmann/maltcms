Release Notes

Changes for version 1.3:
---------------------------

New features

* BiPACE and BiPACE2D pipelines for alignment of peak lists from 1D and 2D chromatography-mass spectrometry.
* Maltcms artifacts now expose osgi dependency information and can be deployed 
in osgi-compatible runtime containers. The maltcms-osgi-distribution module lists all required 
dependencies.
* The maltcms-nbm module provides NetBeans Rich Client Platform compatible modules.
* Preliminary support for Agilent Chemstation _.D_ directories with peak reports in '.xls' format.
* MS/N Support for mzML, also available for custom NetCDF format via ms_level variable.
* Preliminary Support for extraction of mzML TIC chromatograms via total_ion_current_chromatogram and total_ion_current_chromatogram_scan_acquisition_time.
* New optional caching system for lower memory footprint.

This version is backwards compatible to 1.2.x releases of maltcms concerning the workflow format. However, some commands have additional properties, so please check whether your pipelines require updating. Parameters are introduced with sensible default values, usually meaning that they are not used when not explicitly configured. Go <a href="fragmentCommands.html">here</a> for more information on how to inquire a fragment command for its supported parameters.
