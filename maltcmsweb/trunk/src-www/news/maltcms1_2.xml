        <h1>Maltcms 1.2 Released on April 20th, 2012</h1>
        <p>The Modular Application Toolkit for Chromatography Mass Spectrometry project is a framework mainly for programmers
            and power-users for data preprocessing tasks, such as filtering, baseline correction, peak finding, alignment,
            and visualization of high-throughput data.
        </p>
        Maltcms 1.2.0 has seen a large number of changes:
        <ul>
			<li>Reworking of the TICPeakFinder for improved baseline and SNR estimation leading to better and more consistent integration results.</li>
			<li>New Savitzky-Golay filter for local polynomial smoothing.</li>
			<li>ANDIChromImporter now remaps to ANDI-MS for easier compatibility with existing commands.</li>
			<li>Added peak normalization and export facilities for aligned peaks and their areas.</li>
			<li>Parallelized PeakCliqueAlignment similarity calculations.</li>
			<li>Reorganized CWT-based peak finding classes.</li>
        </ul>    
        Known Issues:
        <ul>
            <li>(From 1.1) Xml io providers (except for mzML) may be rather slow on access, this will be fixed in one of the next releases.</li>
        </ul>
