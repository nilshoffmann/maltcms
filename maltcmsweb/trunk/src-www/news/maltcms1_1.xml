        <h1>Maltcms 1.1 Released on February 10th, 2012</h1>
        <p>The Modular Application Toolkit for Chromatography Mass Spectrometry project is a framework mainly for programmers
            and power-users for data preprocessing tasks, such as filtering, baseline correction, peak finding, alignment,
            and visualization of high-throughput data.
        </p>
        Maltcms 1.1.0 has seen a large number of changes:
        <ul>
            <li>Changed configuration system from property files to Spring XML Bean definition format for improved and easier and more flexible exchange/configuration of components.</li>
            <li>Integration of the MPAXS parallelization framework for much simpler parallelization with automatic task synchronization.</li>
            <li>Improvements on running time and space usage of the alignment algorithms.</li>
            <li>New Wavelet-based peak finding algorithm for GCxGC-MS data.</li>
            <li>Improved TIC-based peak finding algorithm for GC-MS data (and general one-dimensional trajectory data).</li>
            <li>Refactorings and cleanup in various areas to reduce interdependencies of modules.</li>
            <li>Integration of the Groovy scripting language.</li>
        </ul>    
        Known Issues:
        <ul>
            <li>Xml io providers (except for mzML) may be rather slow on access, this will be fixed in one of the next releases.</li>
        </ul>
