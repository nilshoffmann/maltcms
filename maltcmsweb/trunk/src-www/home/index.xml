		<h2>ChromAUI featured as a Netbeans RCP application</h2>
		<p>After a recent inquiry about our project ChromAUI from Geertjan Wielenga, I prepared a few screenshots of the current prototype and wrote short descriptions for them.
		Visit <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/geertjan/entry/metabolomics_and_proteomics_on_the" target="_blank">Geertjan Wielenga's blog</a> to see for yourself.</p>
		<h1>About Maltcms and ChromA</h1>
		<h2>What is Maltcms?</h2>
		<p>
			Maltcms, short for "Modular Application Toolkit for Chromatography Mass-Spectrometry" is an application framework 
			mainly suited for developers working in the domain of bioinformatics for metabolomics and proteomics. Its aim is to 
			provide reusable, efficient datastructures, abstracting from the various low-level data-formats like netcdf (ANDIMS), mzXML, mzData and mzML
			and providing consistent access to data features like mass spectra, chromatograms and metadata. Furthermore, Maltcms provides a platform 
			for the implementation and execution of processing pipelines. New and existing algorithms can be easily implemented or included and executed together with 
			existing processing elements.   
		</p>
		<p>For a more extensive list of features, please refer to the <ref target="users/features"/> section.</p>
		
		<h2>What is ChromA/ChromA4D?</h2>
		<p>
			ChromA and ChromA4D are particular pipelines of defined processing elements, which realize the typical workflow of GC-MS/LC-MS (ChromA) and 
			GCxGC-MS (ChromA4D) data analysis.
		</p>
		
		<h1>Future Developments</h1>
		<p>We are currently developing a rich client application, called ChromAUI, which is based on the Netbeans RCP framework.
		The aim of this RCP application is, to allow manual interaction with the data, as well as visualization of raw and processed data. However, 
		it will also be possible to define custom processing pipelines, run them as batch tasks and inspect the results, while they are being created.
		If you are interested to try ChromAUI, please go to <ref target="info/contact"/>.</p>
		<p>
		An early preview and some screenshots of ChromAUI are now featured on <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/geertjan/entry/metabolomics_and_proteomics_on_the" target="_blank">Geertjan Wielenga's blog</a>.
