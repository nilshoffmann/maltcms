Getting started

Prerequisites:
Maven support either with installed maven or via IDE
JAVA 6 SDK 

Below
	src/main/java/maltcms/commands/fragments2d/peakfinding/
add a class with your choice of name for it 
in this package. The main (plugin) class which should run within the 
pipeline system should extend
cross.commands.fragments.AFragmentCommand

Please add the fully qualified name of your class, e.g.
maltcms.commands.fragments2d.peakfinding.MyPeakFinder
to the file 
src/main/resources/META-INF/services/maltcms.commands.fragments.AFragmentCommand

For more details on working with 2D chromatograms, please see the code in 
the maltcms-chroma4D-cwt and maltcms-chroma4D-srg plugins.

To build a ready-to-run version of Maltcms with ChromA4D and your plugin, go to the 
basedir of the project (cd ..) and run mvn install.
Then change to maltcms-chroma4D-srg-dist/target/maltcms-chroma4D-srg-dist-2.0-SNAPSHOT/
