NOTE: The order of the following steps may be essential!


COMPILING
To compile the project, call
>mvn compile

INSTALLATION
To install artifacts in the user repository, call
>mvn install

BUILDING A PACAKGE
To build the project artifacts EXPLICITLY (already 
done by mvn install), call
>mvn package

DEPLOYING SNAPSHOTS FOR SHARED ACCESS
In order to keep everyone developing up to date, 
you should deploy your build snapshots from time to time,
by issuing
>mvn deploy


PERFORMING A RELEASE (Stable version)

To perform a release, first perform
>svn update 
and resolve all possible problems. Then commit all 
local changes with
>svn commit -m "Preparing for release"
Then, go on and call
>mvn release:prepare -Dusername=MYUSERNAME -Dpassword=MYPASSWORD
with MYUSERNAME substituted by your subversion username and MYPASSWORD
subst. by your subverions password.
Maven will prompt you for version numbers for all submodules, simply 
hit enter if the numbers are fine. 

If all went well, you can now call
>mvn release:perform
otherwise, to rollback the release in case of errors:
>mvn release:rollback
